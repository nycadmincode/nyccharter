administration,  the  taxi  and  limousine commission, the department of
youth and community development, the office to combat domestic violence,
and the  office  of  immigrant  affairs;  provided,  however,  that  the
department  of  health  and mental hygiene, as it deems appropriate, may
designate additional agencies to be participating agencies.
  b. Participating agencies shall be required to:  (i)  distribute  such
public   health  insurance  program  options  pamphlet  to  all  persons
requesting   a   written   application   for   services,   renewal    or
recertification  of services or request for a change of address relating
to the provision of services by such  agency;  provided,  however,  that
this  section  shall  not  apply  to  services  that must be provided to
prevent actual or potential danger to the life, health or safety of  any
individual  or  to  the  public;  (ii) include a public health insurance
program options pamphlet with any agency communication sent through  the
United  States  mail  for  the purpose of supplying an individual with a
written application for services, renewal or recertification of services
or with a request for a change of address form relating to the provision
of services by such agency; and (iii)  provide  an  opportunity  for  an
individual  requesting  a  written  application for services, renewal or
recertification for services or change of address form relating  to  the
provision  of  services  by  such  agency  via the Internet to request a
public health insurance  program  options  pamphlet,  and  provide  such
pamphlet,  by  United  States  mail  or  an  Internet address where such
pamphlet may be viewed or downloaded, to any person  who  indicates  via
the Internet that they wish to be sent a public health insurance program
options  pamphlet;  provided,  however,  that  the  taxi  and  limousine
commission shall only  be  required  to  distribute  the  public  health
insurance  program  options  pamphlet  to  those persons applying for or
renewing a driver&#39;s license  or  vehicle  license  as  those  terms  are
defined  in  section 19-502 of this code; and provided further, that the
board of education shall be required only  to  ensure  that  the  public
health  insurance  program  options  pamphlet  is  distributed  to those
individuals who appear in person to  register  a  child  in  the  public
school system.
  c.  Participating  agencies  shall  ensure  that the employees of such
agency do not make any statement to an applicant for services or  client
or  take  any  action  the  purpose  or  effect  of which is to lead the
applicant or client to believe that a decision to request public  health
insurance  or a public health insurance program options pamphlet has any
bearing on their eligibility to receive or the availability of  services
or benefits provided by such agency.
  d. Each participating agency shall request that any contractor of such
agency  operating  pursuant  to a contract which (i) is in excess of two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars and (ii) requires such contractor  to

supply individuals with a written application for, or written renewal or
recertification  of  services,  or request for change of address form in
the  daily  administration  of  their  contractual  obligation  to  such
participating  agency, fulfill the obligations of participating agencies
under this section.
  e. Each participating agency may establish  procedures  as  they  deem
necessary  to  implement  the  local  law  that  added this section. The
commissioner or head of a participating agency, with the concurrence  of
the  commissioner  of  the  department of health and mental hygiene, may
exclude a program in whole or in part  from  the  requirements  of  this
section  upon determining that the inclusion of such a program would not
substantially further the purpose of  the  local  law  that  added  this
section.  The  commissioner  or  head  of each participating agency that
administers programs receiving funds under the workforce investment  act
of  1998,  as  codified  at  29  U.S.C.  § 2801 et seq., shall, with the
concurrence of the commissioner of the department of health  and  mental
hygiene,  determine  which  workforce  investment  act offices providing
workforce development services, including core and intensive services or
substantive training funded in whole or in part by the city&#39;s  share  of
funds provided under such workforce investment act, shall be required to
fulfill  the  obligations  of participating agencies under this section;
such determination shall be based upon whether  the  inclusion  of  such
offices  would  substantially  further the purpose of the local law that
added this section. A copy of each determination made pursuant  to  this
subdivision  shall  be  forwarded  to  the  council and the mayor within
thirty days of such determination.
