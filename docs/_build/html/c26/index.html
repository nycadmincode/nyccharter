<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  §  645.  Offices of the department; powers and duties. (a) There shall
be a main office of the department and in  each  borough  at  least  one
branch  office  and  a  borough  superintendent.  Persons  appointed  as
inspectors to perform  functions  of  the  department  shall  have  such
qualifications  as  shall  be prescribed by the commissioner of citywide
administrative  services  after  consultation  with  the   commissioner;
provided however that such qualifications shall include:
  (1)  a  minimum  of  five  years  acceptable  experience  working at a
construction trade; or
  (2) a license as a professional engineer or architect issued  pursuant
to the education law; or
  (3)  a  minimum  of  three years of acceptable experience working at a
construction trade and a minimum of two  years  of  formal  training  or
education  in  an  acceptable  construction program, with an emphasis on
construction, in a college, technical school or trade school; or
  (4) a minimum of two years  of  acceptable  experience  working  at  a

education in an acceptable construction program,  with  an  emphasis  on
construction,  at  a  college,  trade  school  or technical school and a
minimum of three years participation in an apprentice inspection program
approved  by  the  commissioner  and  the   commissioner   of   citywide
administrative services.
  (b)   With respect to buildings and structures, the commissioner shall
have the following powers and duties exclusively, subject to review only
by the board of standards and appeals as provided by law:
  (1)  to examine and approve or disapprove plans for  the  construction
or  alteration  of any building or structure, including the installation
or alteration of any  service  equipment  therein,  and  to  direct  the
inspection  of  such  building  or  structure, and the service equipment
therein, in the course of construction, installation or alteration;
  (2)  to require that the construction or alteration of any building or
structure, including the  installation  or  alteration  of  any  service
equipment therein, shall be in accordance with the provisions of law and
the rules, regulations and orders applicable thereto; but where there is
a  practical  difficulty in the way of carrying out the strict letter of
any provision of law relating to buildings in  respect  to  the  use  of
prescribed  materials,  or  the  installation  or  alteration of service
equipment, or methods of construction and where equally safe and  proper
materials  or  forms of construction may be employed in a specific case,
he  may  permit  the  use  of  such  materials  or  of  such  forms   of
construction,  provided  that  the  spirit of the law shall be observed,
safety secured and substantial justice done, but he shall have no  power
to  allow  any  variance  from  the provisions of any law in any respect
except as expressly allowed therein, or from any appellate ruling of the
board of standards and appeals;
  (3)  to issue certificates of occupancy for any building or  structure
situated in the city, provided that:
  a.  no  building or structure hereafter constructed may be occupied or
used in whole or  in  part  for  any  purpose  until  a  certificate  of
occupancy has been issued;
  b.    no building or structure or part thereof for which a certificate
of occupancy has  not  been  previously  issued  or  required  shall  be
occupied  or  used  for any purpose whatever in case such building shall
hereafter be altered or converted so as  to  decrease  or  increase  the
number  of  living rooms or apartments, until a certificate of occupancy
has been issued, except that this requirement shall not apply to any old
law or new law tenement wherein two  or  more  apartments  are  combined
creating  larger  residential  units, the total legal number of families

within the building is being decreased, and the bulk of the building  is
not being increased;
  c.    no  buildings  hereafter  altered or converted from one class to
another class shall be occupied or used for any purpose whatever in case
such building was vacant during  the  progress  of  the  work,  until  a
certificate  of  occupancy  has been issued;  in case such an alteration
does not necessitate the vacating of the building during the progress of
the work, the occupancy or use of the building shall not  continue  more
than  thirty  days  after  the  completion  of such alteration, unless a
certificate of occupancy has been issued;
  d.   a certificate of occupancy  of  a  building  or  structure  shall
certify  that such building or structure conforms to the requirements of
all laws, rules, regulations and orders applicable to it and shall be in
such form as the commissioner shall direct;
  e.  every certificate of occupancy shall, unless and until set  aside,
vacated  or modified by the board of standards and appeals or a court of
competent jurisdiction, be and remain binding and  conclusive  upon  all
agencies  and  officers of the city, and shall be binding and conclusive

borough in the name of the commissioner for such times  and  under  such
conditions  as  he  may specify.   The borough superintendent shall also
perform such other duties as the commissioner may direct.

  (d) The commissioner shall review and certify any proposed subdivision
of a zoning lot with any building thereon, in order to ensure  that  the
subdivision  will  not  result in any violation of the applicable zoning
laws.
  For  such  purposes,  the  subdivision  applicant  shall file with the
commissioner, prior to recordation with the city register or the  county
clerk in the case of Staten Island the following:
  (1)  a  subdivision  map  of  the  entire original zoning lot with any
