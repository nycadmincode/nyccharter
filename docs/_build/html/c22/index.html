<p>Section 551.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  §  551.  Department; commissioner.   a. There shall be a department of
health and mental hygiene, the head of which shall be  the  commissioner
of  health  and  mental hygiene who shall be appointed by the mayor. The
department shall  have  and  exercise  all  powers  of  a  local  health
department set forth in law. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
charter  to  the  contrary,  the  department  shall be a social services
district for purposes of the  administration  of  health-related  public
assistance  programs  to  the  extent agreed upon by the department, the
department of social services and the department of  homeless  services.
Appropriations  to  the department for mental health, mental retardation
and alcoholism services shall be set forth  in  the  expense  budget  in
separate  and distinct units of appropriation. In determining the annual
amount of city funds to be appropriated by the city for  mental  health,
mental  retardation  and  alcoholism  services,  the following provision
shall apply: in the event that the executive budget proposes a  decrease
in  city  funds measured against the budget for the current fiscal year,
as modified in accordance with section one hundred seven, for the  units
of  appropriation  for  mental health, mental retardation and alcoholism
services, the executive budget shall not propose  a  greater  percentage
decrease  in  city  funds  measured  against  the budget for the current
fiscal year, as modified in accordance with section one  hundred  seven,
for the units of appropriation for mental health, mental retardation and
alcoholism   services   than   has   been  proposed  for  the  units  of
appropriation for public health services. If, however,  in  his  or  her
discretion,  the mayor determines that it is in the city&#39;s best interest
to submit an executive budget at variance with the requirements of  this
provision,  the mayor shall include an explanation of the basis for this
variation as part of the budget message.
  b. The commissioner shall be a doctor of medicine and:
  (1) hold a degree of master of public health or a degree of master  of
business  administration  with  concentration  in  the health field or a
degree of master of public  administration  with  concentration  in  the
health  field  or  the  equivalent of any one of the specified foregoing
degrees received from a college or university and have had at least five
years&#39; experience in college or university public health teaching, or
  (2) have  had  at  least  five  years&#39;  experience  in  public  health
administration.

<p>Section 558.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  §  558. Health code. (a) The health code which is in force in the city
on the date  on  which  this  chapter  takes  effect  and  all  existing
provisions  of  law  fixing penalties for violations of the code and all
regulations of the board of health on file with the city  clerk  on  the
date  when this chapter takes effect shall continue to be binding and in
force except as amended or repealed from time to time. Such  code  shall
have the force and effect of law.
  (b)  The board of health from time to time may add to and alter, amend
or repeal  any  part  of  the  health  code,  and  may  therein  publish
additional  provisions  for  security of life and health in the city and
confer additional powers on the department  not  inconsistent  with  the
constitution,  laws  of  this state or this charter, and may provide for
the  enforcement  of  the  health  code  or  any  orders  made  by   the
commissioner   or  the  board  of  health,  by  such  fines,  penalties,
forfeitures and imprisonment as may be prescribed therein  or  otherwise
by law.
  (c) The board of health may embrace in the health code all matters and
subjects to which the power and authority of the department extends. The
board of health shall prescribe in the health code the persons who shall
be  required  to  keep  a  registry  of  birth, fetal deaths, and deaths
occurring  in  the  city  and  file  certifications  thereof  with   the
department  and the form and manner in which such registry shall be kept
and certificates filed, and, it  shall  provide  for  the  recording  of
births  which  have  not  been  recorded in accordance with law, for the
change or alteration of any birth, fetal death or death certificate upon
proof  satisfactory,  to  the  commissioner,  for  the  examination  and
issuance  of transcripts of such certificates and for fees to be charged
therefor.
  (d) The board of health shall prescribe in the health  code  that  the
parent  with  legal custody or legal guardian of any child receiving day
care services as authorized in such code shall  have  unlimited  and  on
demand access to such child or ward. The department of health and mental
hygiene  shall make unannounced visits of such day care services if such
board receives a complaint that, if true, would indicate  that  children
in  such  services  are not receiving adequate or appropriate care. Such
board shall also prescribe in such code that during the period for which
day care services are authorized upon any premises, the department shall
whenever possible make at least one  unannounced  visit  of  every  such
premises annually.
  (e)  Any violation of the health code shall be treated and punished as
a misdemeanor.  The  board  of  health  or  an  administrative  tribunal
established  by  the  board  of  health to enforce the provisions of the
health code shall have the power to  enforce  its  final  decisions  and
orders  imposing  pecuniary  penalties  as if they were money judgments,
without court proceedings, in the manner described  herein.  After  four
months  from  the  issuance  of  such a final decision and order by such
board or tribunal a copy of such decision and order shall  be  filed  in
the office of the clerk of any county within the city. In the event that
the  decision  and order were issued as a result of the respondent being
in default, a notice of default shall be mailed to  such  respondent  at
least  seven  days  before  such filing, and a copy of such notice and a
receipt of mailing thereof shall be filed with the copy of such decision
and order. Upon such filing, such county clerk shall  enter  and  docket
such  decision and order, in the same manner and with the same effect as
a money judgment. Upon such entry and docketing, such decision and order
may be enforced as provided in article fifty-two of the  civil  practice
law and rules. Such board or tribunal shall not enter any final decision
or  order  pursuant  to  the  provisions  of this subdivision unless the

notice of violation shall have been served in  the  same  manner  as  is
prescribed for service of process by article three of the civil practice
law  and  rules  or  article three of the business corporation law. Such
board  or  tribunal  may  apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for
enforcement of any other decision, order  or  subpoena  issued  by  such
board  or tribunal. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit
or abridge the board&#39;s or the department&#39;s right  to  pursue  any  other
remedy  prescribed  by  law.  Pecuniary  penalties for violations of the
health code may be recovered in a civil action before any court  in  the
city having jurisdiction of civil actions.
  (f)  No  amendment  or  addition  to  the health code or repeal of any
provision thereof adopted by the  board  of  health  subsequent  to  the
effective  date of this chapter shall become valid and effective until a
copy of such amendment, addition or repeal  is  duly  certified  by  the
person serving as secretary of the board.
  (g)  The  board  of  health  may  add, amend and repeal regulations in
regard to any matter contained in the health code, and such  regulations
shall have the same force and effect as a provision of the health code.
  (h)  No  action  shall  abate,  or  right of action already accrued be
abolished, by reason of the  expiration,  repeal  or  amendment  of  any
provision of the health code or regulations in regard thereto.

be  allowed  actual  and  necessary  expenses  to be audited in the same
manner as other city charges.
  (3) No person shall be ineligible for membership on the board  or  its
