<p>Section 81.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  §  81.  Qualifications;  election;  term; salary; removal; vacancy. a.
There shall be a president of each borough,  who  shall  be  a  resident
thereof at the time of election and remain a resident thereof throughout
the term of office.
  b.  The  borough  president  shall  be  elected by the electors of the
borough at the same time and for  the  same  term  as  in  this  charter
prescribed  for the mayor. A borough president who resigns or is removed
from office prior to the completion of a full term shall  be  deemed  to
have served a full term for purposes of section 1138 of the charter.
  c.  The  salary  of  the  borough president shall be one hundred sixty
thousand dollars a year.
  d. A president of a borough may be removed or suspended  in  the  same
manner as provided in this charter with respect to the mayor.
  e. Any vacancy in the office of a borough president shall be filled by
popular  election  in the manner set forth in this subdivision. Until an
interim or permanent successor is  first  elected,  the  deputy  borough
president or the executive assistant, in the order of priority specified
by  the  borough  president  pursuant  to  subdivision  one  of  section
eighty-two, shall act as borough president.
  1. Within three days of the occurrence  of  a  vacancy  in  a  borough
presidency,  the  mayor  shall  proclaim  the  date  for the election or
elections  required  by  this  subdivision,  provide  notice   of   such
proclamation  to  the  city clerk and the board of elections and publish
notice thereof in the City Record. After the proclamation  of  the  date
for  an  election to be held pursuant to paragraphs four or five of this
subdivision, the city clerk shall publish notice thereof not  less  than
twice  in  each  week  preceding the date of such election in newspapers
distributed within the city, and  the  board  of  elections  shall  mail
notice  of such election to all registered voters within the appropriate
borough.
  2. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years  of  the  term,  a
general  election to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired
term shall be held in the year in which the vacancy occurs,  unless  the
vacancy  occurs  after the last day on which an occurring vacancy may be
filled at the general election in that same year with party  nominations
of  candidates  for  such  election being made at a primary election, as
provided in section 6-116 of the election law. If such vacancy occurs in
any year after such last day, it shall be filled for  the  remainder  of
the  unexpired  term  at  the  general  election  in  the following year
provided, however, that no general election to fill a vacancy  shall  be
held  in the last year of the term, except as provided in paragraph nine
of this subdivision. Party  nominations  of  candidates  for  a  general
election to fill a vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall
be  made  at a primary election, except as provided in paragraph five of
this subdivision.
  3. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an  interim
basis  has  not  been  previously held pursuant to paragraphs four, six,
seven and eight of this subdivision, the  person  elected  to  fill  the
vacancy  for  the  remainder of the unexpired term at a general election
shall take office immediately upon qualification and shall  serve  until
the  term  expires. If a special or general election to fill the vacancy
on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill
the vacancy for the  remainder  of  the  unexpired  term  at  a  general
election  shall  take office on January first of the year following such
general election and shall serve until the term expires.
  4. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term and on
or before the last day in the  third  year  of  the  term  on  which  an
occurring  vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term

at a general election with party  nominations  of  candidates  for  such
election  being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116
of the election law, a special or general election to fill  the  vacancy
on  an  interim basis shall be held, unless the vacancy occurs less than
ninety days before the next primary election at which party  nominations
for  a general election to fill the vacancy may be made and on or before
the last day on which  an  occurring  vacancy  may  be  filled  for  the
remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the same year
in  which  the  vacancy  occurs with party nominations of candidates for
such election being made at a primary election, as provided  in  section
6-116 of the election law.
  5.  If  a  vacancy  occurs after the last day in the third year of the
term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for  the  remainder  of
the  unexpired  term  at  a  general  election  in  each year with party
nominations of candidates for such election  being  made  at  a  primary
election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, but not less
than  ninety  days before the date of the primary election in the fourth
year of such term, a special or general election to  fill  such  vacancy
for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held.
  6.  Elections  held  pursuant  to  paragraph  four  or  five  of  this
subdivision shall be  scheduled  in  the  following  manner:  A  special
election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least
forty-five  days  after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the
mayor,  in  the  proclamation  required  by  paragraph   one   of   this
subdivision, may schedule such election for another day no more than ten
days  after  such  Tuesday  and  not  less  than  forty  days after such
proclamation if the mayor determines that such rescheduling is necessary
to facilitate maximum voter participation; except that
  (a) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any  year  and
the  first  Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence of the
vacancy is less than ninety days before a  regularly  scheduled  general
election  or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy shall
be filled at such general election; and
  (b) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any  year  and
the  first  Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence of the
vacancy is after a regularly scheduled  general  election,  the  vacancy
shall be filled at such general election; and
  (c)  if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any year
and the first Tuesday at least forty-five days after the  occurrence  of
the  vacancy  is  after,  but  less  than thirty days after, a regularly
scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be  filled  at  a  special
election to be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year.
  7.  All  nominations  for elections to fill vacancies held pursuant to
paragraphs four and five of this subdivision  shall  be  by  independent
nominating  petition.  A signature on an independent nominating petition
made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one
of this subdivision shall not be counted.
  8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in a borough  presidency  at  an
election  held pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision shall take
office  immediately  upon  qualification  and   serve   until   December
thirty-first  of  the  year  in  which  the  vacancy  is  filled for the
remainder of the unexpired  term  pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of  this
subdivision.  A person elected to fill a vacancy in a borough presidency
at an election held pursuant to paragraph five of this subdivision shall
take office immediately upon qualification  and  serve  until  the  term
expires.
  9.  If  a  vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the date of the
primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the

general election in such year for the next succeeding  term  shall  take
office  immediately  upon  qualification  and  fill  the vacancy for the
remainder of the unexpired term.
