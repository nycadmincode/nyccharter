of March, two thousand three. The members shall all be individuals  with
extensive  experience and knowledge in the fields of finance, economics,
accounting, public administration and public policy analysis,  including
at  least  one former director of the New York city office of management
and budget or of a  comparable  office  in  another  local  governmental

matters; and one officer or former officer of a human services  advocacy
organization  involved  in budget matters.  No member may be reappointed
to  consecutive  terms. Vacancies occurring because of the expiration of
terms shall be filled promptly on the recommendation of the  members  of
the   committee  whose  terms  are  not  expiring.  Vacancies  occurring
otherwise  shall  be  filled  promptly  on  the  recommendation  of  the
remaining  members of the committee.  The members of the committee shall
receive no compensation but shall  be  reimbursed  for  their  necessary
expenses.  The  committee  shall  at  its  first  meeting  in every even
numbered year elect, from among its members, a chair and vice-chair  who
shall  serve  until  the  thirty-first  day  of  March  of the next even
numbered year.
