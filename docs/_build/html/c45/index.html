<p>Section 1042.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  §  1042.  Regulatory agenda. a. Each agency shall publish by the first
day of May annually, a regulatory agenda which shall contain:
  1. a brief description of the subject areas in which it is anticipated
that rules may be promulgated during the next fiscal year,  including  a
description of the reasons why action by the agency is being considered;
  2. a summary, to the extent known, of the anticipated contents of each
such proposed rule, its objectives and legal basis;
  3. a description of the types of individuals and entities likely to be
subject to the rule;
  4.  an  identification,  to  the  extent  practicable, of all relevant
federal, state, and local laws and  rules,  including  those  which  may
duplicate, overlap or conflict with the proposed rule; and
  5.  an  approximate  schedule  for adopting the proposed rule, and the
name and telephone number of an agency official knowledgeable about each
subject area involved.
  b. Each agency the single head of which  is  appointed  by  the  mayor
shall forward to the mayor its regulatory agenda. The mayor shall review
such  regulatory agenda to determine whether regulations contemplated by
city  agencies  are  consistent  with  the  policy  objectives  of   the
administration.
  c.  Failure  to  include  an  item  in  a  regulatory agenda shall not
preclude action thereon. If rulemaking is undertaken  on  a  matter  not
included in the regulatory agenda the agency shall include in the notice
of  proposed  rulemaking  the  reason  the rule was not anticipated. The
inadvertent failure to provide the reason such rule was not included  in
the regulatory agenda shall not serve to invalidate the rule.

<h2>Section 1043.<a class="headerlink" href="#section-1043" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Section 1043.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  §  1043.  Rulemaking.  a. Authority. Each agency is empowered to adopt
rules necessary to carry out the powers and duties delegated to it by or
pursuant to federal, state or local law. No agency shall  adopt  a  rule
except pursuant to this section. Each such rule shall be simply written,
using ordinary language where possible.
  b.  Notice. 1. Each agency shall publish the full text of the proposed
rule in the City Record at least thirty days prior to the date set for a
public hearing to be held pursuant to the requirements of subdivision  e
of  this  section  or  the  final  date for receipt of written comments,
whichever is earlier. A proposed rule amending an  existing  rule  shall
contain  in brackets any part to be deleted and shall have underlined or
italicized any new part to  be  added.  A  proposed  rule  repealing  an
existing  rule  shall contain in brackets the rule to be repealed, or if
the full text of the rule was published in the Compilation  required  to
be published pursuant to section one thousand forty-five, shall give the
citation  of the rule to be repealed and a summary of its contents. Such
published notice shall include  a  draft  statement  of  the  basis  and
purpose  of  the  proposed  rule, the statutory authority, including the
particular sections and subdivisions upon which the action is based, the
time and place of public hearing, if any, to be held or the reason  that
a  public  hearing  will  not be held, and the final date for receipt of
written  comments.  If  the  proposed  rule  was  not  included  in  the
regulatory  agenda,  such  notice shall also include the reason the rule
was not anticipated,  as  required  in  subdivision  c  of  section  one
thousand forty-two of this chapter.
  2.   Copies   of   the  full  text  of  the  proposed  rule  shall  be
electronically transmitted to the office of the speaker of the  council,
the  council&#39;s office of legislative documents, the corporation counsel,
each council member, the chairs of all community boards, the news  media
and  civic  organizations  no  later  than the date the proposed rule is
transmitted to the City Record for publication pursuant to paragraph one
of subdivision b of this section; provided that an  inadvertent  failure
to fully comply with the notice requirements of this paragraph shall not
serve to invalidate any rule.
  3. (a) News media, for the purposes of this subdivision, shall include
(i)  all  radio  and television stations broadcasting in the city of New
York, all newspapers  published  in  the  city  of  New  York  having  a
city-wide  or  borough-wide  circulation, and any newspaper of any labor
union or trade association representing an  industry  affected  by  such
rule,  and  (ii)  any  community newspaper or any other publication that
requests such notification on an annual basis.
  (b) Civic organizations, for the purposes of this  subdivision,  shall
include  any  city-wide or borough-wide organization or any labor union,
trade association or other group that requests such notification  on  an
annual basis.
  4.  In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraph one of this
subdivision, each agency shall provide information regarding the  public
hearing  to  be  held  with  regard  to  a  proposed rule in a prominent
location on such agency&#39;s website at least seven days prior to the  date
set  for such hearing. Each agency shall further provide, in a prominent
location on such agency&#39;s website, a link to the NYC Rules online portal
or any successor city website or page that is substantially  similar  in
form or function. Each agency shall, to the greatest extent practicable,
and  in  addition  to the electronic transmissions required by paragraph
two  of  this  subdivision,  publicize  upcoming  public  hearings   via
electronic  means  that  are  likely  to reach interested members of the
public. This paragraph shall not be construed to create a private  right

of  action to enforce its provisions. Inadvertent failure to comply with
this paragraph shall not result in the invalidation of any rule.
  c. Review of statutory authority. The corporation counsel shall review
the  proposed  rule  to  determine  whether  it  is within the authority
delegated by law to the agency proposing the rule.  If  the  corporation
counsel  determines  that  the  proposed rule is not within the agency&#39;s
delegated authority, the corporation counsel shall notify the agency  in
writing prior to the publication of the final rule in the City Record.
  d.  1.  The  law department and the mayor&#39;s office of operations shall
review each proposed rule prior to publication of such proposed rule  in
the  City  Record.  At  the conclusion of its review, the law department
shall state whether  each  proposed  rule:  (i)  is  drafted  so  as  to
accomplish the purpose of the authorizing provisions of law; (ii) is not
in conflict with other applicable rules; (iii) to the extent practicable
and  appropriate,  is  narrowly drawn to achieve its stated purpose; and
(iv) to the extent practicable and appropriate, contains a statement  of
basis  and purpose that provides a clear explanation of the rule and the
requirements imposed by the rule. As part of  its  review,  the  mayor&#39;s
office  of  operations  shall  analyze each proposed rule and state: (a)
whether such rule is understandable and written in plain  language;  (b)
how  the  drafting  process  of  the rule, to the extent practicable and
appropriate, included analysis sufficient  to  minimize  the  compliance
costs for the discrete regulated community or communities, to the extent
one  exists,  consistent  with achieving the stated purpose of the rule;
and (c) why, in the event such rule  involves  the  establishment  of  a
violation,  modification of a violation or modification of the penalties
associated with a violation without also including  a  cure  period,  or
other  opportunity  for  ameliorative  action  by  the  party or parties
subject to enforcement,  such  cure  period  or  other  opportunity  for
ameliorative  action  was  not  included. Provided, however, that if the
proposed rule solely establishes or modifies the amount  of  a  monetary
penalty  or penalties then the law department statement required by this
paragraph shall not be required  and  the  analysis  of  the  office  of
operations  may  be  limited  to  the reason or reasons a cure period or
other opportunity for ameliorative action was not included.
  2. After completing the review as set forth in paragraph one  of  this
subdivision,  the  law  department  and the mayor&#39;s office of operations
shall certify that they have performed such review, and  shall  promptly
transmit  a copy of such certification, including the analysis performed
by the mayor&#39;s office of operations, to the relevant agency. Such agency
shall annex such certification and analysis to  the  full  text  of  the
proposed  rule  as  published in the City Record. Such certification and
analysis shall also be made  available  to  the  public  on  the  city&#39;s
website  and  transmitted to the speaker of the city council at the time
of publication. In no event shall  a  proposed  rule  be  submitted  for
initial publication in the City Record unless the law department and the
mayor&#39;s   office  of  operations  have  issued  such  certification  and
analysis.
  3. This subdivision shall not be construed to create a  private  right
of  action to enforce its provisions. Inadvertent failure to comply with
this subdivision shall not result in the invalidation of any rule.
  4. This subdivision shall not apply to rules that: (i) are promulgated
pursuant to the emergency procedures set forth in subdivision i of  this
section;   (ii)   are   solely   concerned  with  the  establishment  or
modification of the amount of a monetary penalty or penalties,  and  the
underlying  violation or a modification of the penalties associated with
such violation has previously been analyzed in accordance with paragraph
one  of  this  subdivision;  (iii)  are  solely   concerned   with   the

establishment  or  modification  of  the amount of a fee or fees or (iv)
implement particular mandates or standards set forth  in  newly  enacted
federal,  state,  or  local laws, regulations or other requirements with
only  minor,  if any, exercise of agency discretion in interpreting such
mandates or standards.  If  an  analysis  of  a  proposed  rule  is  not
performed  pursuant to the exceptions noted in this paragraph, such fact
shall be noted and the note annexed to the full  text  of  the  proposed
rule as published in the City Record.
  e. Opportunity for and consideration of agency and public comment. The
agency  shall  provide  the  public  an  opportunity  to  comment on the
proposed rule (i) through outreach to the discrete  regulated  community
or  communities,  if  one exists, provided that this clause shall not be
construed  to  create  a  private  right  of  action  to  enforce   this
requirement;   (ii)  through  submission  of  written  data,  views,  or
arguments, and (iii) at a public hearing unless it is determined by  the
agency  in  writing,  which shall be published in the notice of proposed
rulemaking in the City Record, that such a public hearing on a  proposed
rule  would  serve no public purpose. All written comments and a summary
of oral comments concerning a proposed rule received from the public  or
any  agency  shall  be  placed  in  a  public record and be made readily
available to the public as soon as practicable and in any event within a
reasonable time, not to be delayed because of the continued pendency  of
consideration  of the proposed rule. After consideration of the relevant
comments presented, the agency  may  adopt  a  final  rule  pursuant  to
subdivision  f  of  this section; except that, other than a rule adopted
pursuant to subdivision i of  this  section,  no  final  rule  shall  be
adopted  by such board or commission unless its final language is posted
in a prominent location on  such  agency&#39;s  website  and  electronically
transmitted  to  each  member of such board or commission at least three
calendar days, exclusive of Sundays,  prior  to  such  rule&#39;s  adoption;
provided,  however,  that  revisions  may  be made to a final rule posed
online and sent electronically in conformity with  this  subdivision  at
any  time  prior to the vote on such rule if such revisions are approved
by all members of such board or commission by  unanimous  consent.  Such
final rule may include revisions of the proposed rule, and such adoption
of  revisions  based  on  the consideration of relevant agency or public
comments shall not require further notice and comment pursuant  to  this
section. This paragraph shall not be construed to create a private right
of  action to enforce its provisions. Inadvertent failure to comply with
this paragraph shall not result in the invalidation of any rule.
  f. Effective date. 1. No rule shall be effective until
  (a) the rule is filed by the agency with the corporation  counsel  for
publication in the Compilation,
  (b)  the  rule  and a statement of basis and purpose is transmitted to
the council for its information, and
  (c) the rule and a statement of basis and purpose have been  published
in  the City Record and thirty days have elapsed after such publication.
The  requirement  that  thirty  days  shall  first  elapse  after   such
publication  shall not apply where a finding that a substantial need for
the earlier implementation of a program or policy has been made  by  the
agency  in  writing  and  has  been  approved  by the mayor prior to the
effective date of the rule and such finding and approval is contained in
the notice.
  2. A rule shall be void if it is not published in the next  supplement
to  the  Compilation  in which its publication is practicable; provided,
however, that in the case of an inadvertent failure to publish a rule in
such supplement, the rule shall become effective as of the date  of  its
publication,  if  it  is  published  within  six  months of the date the

corporation  counsel  receives  notice  of  its  omission;  and  further
provided  that  any  judicial  or  administrative  action or proceeding,
whether criminal or civil, commenced under or by virtue of any provision
of  a  rule  voided  pursuant  to this section and pending prior to such
voidance, may be prosecuted and defended to final  effect  in  the  same
manner as they might if such rule had not been so voided.
  g.  Petition  for rules. Any person may petition an agency to consider
the adoption of any rule. Within sixty days after the  submission  of  a
petition, the agency shall either deny such petition in writing, stating
the  reasons  for  denial,  or  state the agency&#39;s intention to initiate
rulemaking,  by  a  specified  date,  concerning  the  subject  of  such
petition.  Each  agency  shall  prescribe  by  rule  the  procedure  for
submission, consideration and disposition of such petitions. In the case
of a board, commission or other body that is  not  headed  by  a  single
person,  such  rules of procedure may authorize such body to delegate to
its chair the authority to reject such petitions. Such decision shall be
within the discretion of the agency and shall not be subject to judicial
review.
  h. Maintenance of comments. Each agency shall establish a  system  for
maintaining  and  making  available  for  public  inspection all written
comments received in response to each notice of rulemaking.
  i. Emergency procedures. 1. Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of
this section, an agency may adopt a rule prior to the notice and comment
otherwise  required  by  this  section if the immediate effectiveness of
such rule is necessary to address an imminent threat to health,  safety,
property  or  a necessary service. A finding of such imminent threat and
the specific reasons for the finding must be  made  in  writing  by  the
agency adopting such rule and shall be approved by the mayor before such
rule  may be made effective. In the event that an elected official other
than the mayor has the authority to promulgate rules, such official  may
make  such  findings  without  prior  mayoral  approval.  The  rule  and
accompanying finding  shall  be  made  public  forthwith  and  shall  be
published in the City Record as soon as practicable. Agencies shall also
electronically  transmit  all  emergency  rules adopted pursuant to this
paragraph to the office of the speaker of  the  council,  the  council&#39;s
office  of  legislative documents, the corporation counsel, each council
member, the chairs of all community boards, the  news  media  and  civic
organizations, as such term is defined in subdivision b of this section,
no  later  than the date the emergency rules are transmitted to the City
Record for publication pursuant to this paragraph.
  2. A rule adopted on an emergency basis shall not remain in effect for
longer than sixty days  unless  the  agency  has  initiated  notice  and
comment  otherwise required by this section within such sixty day period
and publishes with such notice a statement that  an  extension  of  such
rule  on an emergency basis is necessary for an additional sixty days to
afford an opportunity for notice and comment and to adopt a  final  rule
as required by this section; provided that no further such finding of an
emergency  may  be  made  with  respect  to  the same or a substantially
similar rule.

copy  of  each  rule,  as  defined  in  subdivision  five of section one
thousand forty-one, in force as of the first day of January of  nineteen
hundred eighty-nine. Each such rule shall be identified by the agency as
one of the following:
  (a) a rule which should be continued in its present form;
  (b) a rule which should be continued with amendments; or
  (c) a rule which should be repealed.
  2.  Any  amendment  or  repeal of a rule described in paragraph one of
this subdivision, shall be  subject  to  the  provisions  set  forth  in
section one thousand forty-three.
  b.  In regard to all rules submitted pursuant to subdivision a of this
section, the corporation counsel shall
  1. include such rules in the  Compilation  required  to  be  published
pursuant  to  section  one  thousand forty-five; provided, however, that
each rule which  the  agency  identifies  as  a  rule  which  should  be
continued but with amendments, and each rule which the agency identifies
as  a  rule  which  should  be  repealed,  shall  be  published  in  the
Compilation with an appropriate notation as to the agency&#39;s comments and
intentions.  Such notations shall be provided for informational purposes
only and such rule in its present form shall remain in  full  force  and
effect until and unless such rule is amended or repealed pursuant to the
procedures set forth in section one thousand forty-three, and
  2.  submit  to  the  City  Record  for publication by the first day of
September, nineteen hundred ninety, a list of rules  submitted  pursuant
to  subdivisions  a and e of this section, except for rules contained in
the health  code.  Such  list  shall  include  for  each  rule  a  short
descriptive  title, as well as any available identifying names, numbers,
adoption dates or  similar  information  regarding  such  rule;  and  an
indication  of  the  agency&#39;s  intention  to  continue such rule without
amendments, to continue it with amendments or to repeal it.
  c. No rule, as defined in subdivision five  of  section  one  thousand
forty-one,  which  is  in force as of the first day of January, nineteen
hundred eighty-nine shall have any force or effect on or after the tenth
day of August, nineteen hundred and eighty-nine unless it  is  submitted
by the agency to the corporation counsel by such date.
  d.  Except as provided in subdivision e, no rule adopted by any agency
prior to the effective date of this chapter  shall  have  any  force  or
effect  after  the first day of July, nineteen hundred ninety-one unless
it is included in the Compilation required to be published by that  date
pursuant  to  section  one thousand forty-five; provided however that in
the  case  of  an  inadvertent  failure  to  publish  a  rule  in   such
Compilation,  the  rule  shall  become  effective  as of the date of its
publication, if it is published within six  months  from  the  date  the
corporation  counsel  received  notice  of  its  omission,  and  further
provided that any  judicial  or  administrative  action  or  proceeding,

or a description of a rule which such person believes to be in force  as
of the effective date of this chapter. Upon the receipt of a description
or  copy  of  such  a  rule,  the  agency  shall  endeavor to verify the

existence of such rule and upon identifying such rule, if such rule  was
in force and effect as of the effective date of this chapter and has not
been  submitted  to the corporation counsel pursuant to subdivision a of
this  section,  the  agency  shall take the actions required pursuant to
subdivision a of this section, and  notwithstanding  the  provisions  of
subdivisions  c  and  d of this section, such rule shall remain in force
and effect until or unless amended or repealed pursuant to  section  one
thousand forty-three.

such  other  times  as  the  corporation  counsel  shall  determine. The
Compilation and its supplements shall be certified  by  the  corporation
counsel   and   shall  include  every  rule  currently  in  effect.  The
Compilation and its supplements may contain such  other  information  as
the  corporation  counsel  deems  necessary  and  appropriate  for  full
understanding of any rule or which the corporation counsel in his or her
discretion determines may be of interest or assistance  to  the  public.
The  Compilation  and  its  supplements shall be organized by agency and
indexed by subject matter. An indexed edition of the  Compilation  shall
be  published by the first day of July, nineteen hundred and ninety-one,
which date shall be deemed the publication date of the Compilation,  and
shall  be  updated  and  republished  by the first day of March of every
fourth year thereafter.
  b. The rules contained within  the  Compilation  and  its  supplements
