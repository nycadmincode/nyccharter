<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  §  24.  Election;  term;  vacancies.  a.  The public advocate shall be
elected by the electors of the city at the same time and  for  the  same
term  as in this charter prescribed for the mayor. A public advocate who
resigns or is removed from office prior to the completion of a full term
shall be deemed to have held that office for a full term for purposes of
Section 1138 of the charter.
  b. The public advocate may be removed or suspended in the same  manner
as provided in this charter with respect to the mayor.
  c.  Any  vacancy  in  the office of public advocate shall be filled by
popular election in the following manner:
  1. Within three days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the  office  of
the  public advocate, the mayor shall proclaim the date for the election
or elections required  by  this  subdivision,  provide  notice  of  such
proclamation  to  the  city clerk and the board of elections and publish
notice thereof in the City Record. After the proclamation  of  the  date
for  an  election to be held pursuant to paragraphs four or five of this
subdivision, the city clerk shall publish notice thereof not  less  than
twice  in  each  week  preceding the date of such election in newspapers
distributed within the city, and  the  board  of  elections  shall  mail
notice of such election to all registered voters within the city.
  2.  If  a  vacancy  occurs during the first three years of the term, a
general election to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the  unexpired
term  shall  be held in the year in which the vacancy occurs, unless the
vacancy occurs after the last day on which an occurring vacancy  may  be
filled  at the general election in that same year with party nominations
of candidates for such election being made at  a  primary  election,  as
provided  in section 6-116 of the election law. If such a vacancy occurs
in any year after such last day, it shall be filled for the remainder of
the unexpired term  at  the  general  election  in  the  following  year
provided,  however,  that no general election to fill a vacancy shall be
held in the last year of the term, except as provided in paragraph  nine
of  this  subdivision.  Party  nominations  of  candidates for a general
election to fill a vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall
be made at a primary election, except as provided in paragraph  five  of
this subdivision.
  3.  If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim
basis has not been previously held pursuant  to  paragraphs  four,  six,
seven  and  eight  of  this  subdivision, the person elected to fill the
vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at  a  general  election
shall  take  office immediately upon qualification and shall serve until
the term expires. If a special or general election to fill  the  vacancy
on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill
the  vacancy  for  the  remainder  of  the  unexpired  term at a general
election shall take office on January first of the year  following  such
general election and shall serve until the term expires.
  4. If a vacancy occurs during the first three years of the term and on
or  before  the  last  day  in  the  third  year of the term on which an
occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired  term
at  a  general  election  with  party nominations of candidates for such
election being made at a primary election, as provided in section  6-116
of  the  election law, a special or general election to fill the vacancy
on an interim basis shall be held, unless the vacancy occurs  less  than
ninety  days before the next primary election at which party nominations
for a general election to fill the vacancy may be made and on or  before
the  last  day  on  which  an  occurring  vacancy  may be filled for the
remainder of the unexpired term at the general election in the same year
in which the vacancy occurs with party  nominations  of  candidates  for

such  election  being made at a primary election, as provided in section
6-116 of the election law.
  5.  If  a  vacancy  occurs after the last day in the third year of the
term on which an occurring vacancy may be filled for  the  remainder  of
the  unexpired  term  at  a  general  election  in  such year with party
nominations of candidates for such election  being  made  at  a  primary
election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, but not less
than  ninety  days before the date of the primary election in the fourth
year of such term, a special or general election to  fill  such  vacancy
for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held.
  6.  Elections  held  pursuant  to  paragraph  four  or  five  of  this
subdivision shall be  scheduled  in  the  following  manner:  A  special
election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least
forty-five  days  after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the
mayor,  in  the  proclamation  required  by  paragraph   one   of   this
subdivision, may schedule such election for another day no more than ten
days  after  such  Tuesday  and  not  less  than  forty  days after such
proclamation if the mayor determines that such rescheduling is necessary
to facilitate maximum voter participation; except that
  (a) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any  year  and
the  first  Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence of the
vacancy is less than ninety days before a  regularly  scheduled  general
election  or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy shall
be filled at such general election;
  (b) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any  year  and
the  first  Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence of the
vacancy is after a regularly scheduled  general  election,  the  vacancy
shall be filled at such general election; and
  (c)  if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any year
and the first Tuesday at least forty-five days after the  occurrence  of
the  vacancy  is  after,  but  less  than thirty days after, a regularly
scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be  filled  at  a  special
election to be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year.
  7.  All  nominations  for elections to fill vacancies held pursuant to
paragraphs four and five of this subdivision  shall  be  by  independent
nominating  petition.  A signature on an independent nominating petition
made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one
of this subdivision shall not be counted.
  8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of public advocate
at an election held pursuant to paragraph four of this subdivision shall
take office immediately upon  qualification  and  serve  until  December
thirty-first  of  the  year  in  which  the  vacancy  is  filled for the
remainder of the unexpired  term  pursuant  to  paragraph  two  of  this
subdivision.  A person elected to fill a vacancy in the office of public
advocate at  an  election  held  pursuant  to  paragraph  five  of  this
subdivision  shall  take office immediately upon qualification and serve
until the term expires.
  9. If a vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the  date  of  the
primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the
general  election  in  such year for the next succeeding term shall take
office immediately upon qualification  and  fill  the  vacancy  for  the
remainder of the unexpired term.
  d.  The  public  advocate  may,  by  written  authority filed with the
appropriate board, body or committee and with the city clerk,  designate
any  two  officers  or  employees  appointed  by  the public advocate to
exercise the powers specified in this subdivision. Either  such  officer
or  employee, so designated, may act in the place of the public advocate
on any board, body or committee, other than the council,  of  which  the

public advocate is a member whenever the public advocate shall be absent
from a meeting of said board, body or committee for any reason whatever.
  e.  The  public  advocate  shall  have the right to participate in the
discussion of the council but shall not have a vote.
  f. In addition  to  other  duties  and  responsibilities,  the  public
advocate  shall  serve  as the public advocate and shall (1) monitor the
operation of the public information and service  complaint  programs  of
city  agencies  and  make proposals to improve such programs; (2) review
complaints of a recurring and multiborough or city-wide nature  relating
to  services  and  programs,  and  make  proposals to improve the city&#39;s
response  to  such  complaints;  (3)   receive   individual   complaints
concerning  city  services  and  other  administrative  actions  of city
agencies; and (4) investigate and  otherwise  attempt  to  resolve  such
individual  complaints except for those which (i) another city agency is
required by law to adjudicate, (ii) may be resolved through a  grievance
mechanism established by collective bargaining agreement or contract, or
(iii) involve allegations of conduct which may constitute a violation of
criminal  law or a conflict of interest. If the public advocate receives
a complaint which is subject to a procedure described in  items  (i)  or
(ii) of this paragraph, the public advocate shall advise the complainant
of  the  appropriate  procedure for the resolution of such complaint. If
the public advocate receives a complaint of the type described  in  item
(iii)  of  this  paragraph, the public advocate shall promptly refer the
matter in accordance with subdivision k of this section.
  g. The public advocate shall establish procedures  for  receiving  and
processing    complaints,   responding   to   complainants,   conducting
investigations, and reporting findings,  and  shall  inform  the  public
about  such  procedures.  Upon an initial determination that a complaint
may be valid, the public advocate shall  refer  it  to  the  appropriate
agency.  If  such  agency  does  not  resolve  the  complaint  within  a
reasonable time, the public advocate may conduct  an  investigation  and
make  specific  recommendations  to  the  agency  for  resolution of the
complaint. If, within a reasonable time after the  public  advocate  has
completed  an  investigation and submitted recommendations to an agency,
such agency has failed to  respond  in  a  satisfactory  manner  to  the
recommendations,  the  public advocate may issue a report to the council
and the mayor.  Such  report  shall  describe  the  conclusions  of  the
investigation   and   make   such  recommendations  for  administrative,
legislative,  or  budgetary   action,   together   with   their   fiscal
implications,  as  the  public  advocate  deems necessary to resolve the
individual complaint or complaints or to address the underlying problems
discovered in the investigation.
  h. In addition  to  other  duties  and  responsibilities,  the  public
advocate  may  review  the programs of city agencies. Such reviews shall
include,  but  not  be  limited  to,  annual  evaluations  of:  (1)  the
implementation  of  the requirements for coterminality of local services
contained in all subdivisions of section twenty seven hundred four;  (2)
the  effectiveness  of  the  public  information  and  service complaint
programs of city agencies; and (3) the responsiveness of  city  agencies
to  individual  and group requests for data or information regarding the
agencies&#39; structure, activities  and  operations.  The  public  advocate
shall  submit any reports documenting or summarizing such reviews to the
council, mayor and appropriate agency and shall include in such  reports
his  or  her  recommendations for addressing the problems identified and
the fiscal implications of such recommendations.
  i. Except for those matters which involve conduct which may constitute
a violation of criminal law  or  a  conflict  of  interest,  the  public
advocate  may,  on the request of a resident, taxpayer, community board,

council member or borough president,  or  on  his  or  her  own  motion,
inquire  into  any alleged failure of a city officer or agency to comply
with any provision of the charter. If as a result of such  inquiry,  the
public  advocate  concludes  that  there  is  any substantial failure to
comply with any provision of the charter,  he  or  she  shall  submit  a
preliminary  report  documenting  the  conclusions of the inquiry to the
officer or officers and the head  of  each  agency  involved.  Within  a
reasonable  time  after  submitting  such preliminary report, the public
advocate shall issue a final report to the council,  mayor,  and  agency
documenting the conclusions of the inquiry.
  j.  The  public advocate shall have timely access to those records and
documents of city agencies which the public advocate deems necessary  to
complete  the  investigations,  inquiries  and  reviews required by this
section. If a city agency does not comply  with  the  public  advocate&#39;s
request  for such records and documents, the public advocate may request
an appropriate committee of the council to  require  the  production  of
such  records  and  documents  pursuant  to  section  twenty-nine of the
charter. The provisions of this subdivision shall  not  apply  to  those
records  and  documents  of city agencies for which a claim of privilege
may properly be raised or  which  are  prepared  or  maintained  by  the
department  of  investigation for use in any investigation authorized by
chapter thirty-four of the charter.
  k. If the public advocate receives a complaint alleging conduct  which
may constitute a violation of criminal law or a conflict of interest, he
or  she shall promptly refer the complaint regarding criminal conduct to
the department of investigation or, as applicable,  to  the  appropriate
prosecuting attorney or other law enforcement agency and shall refer the
complaint  regarding  conflict  of interest to the conflicts of interest
board. If during the conduct of any investigation,  inquiry,  or  review
authorized  by  this  section,  the  public  advocate discovers that the
matter involves conduct which may constitute a violation of criminal law
or a conflict of interest, he or she shall take no  further  action  but
shall  promptly  refer  the  matter  regarding  criminal  conduct to the
department of  investigation  or,  as  applicable,  to  the  appropriate
prosecuting  attorney or other law enforcement agency and shall promptly
refer the matter regarding conflict of  interest  to  the  conflicts  of
interest  board.  Unless  otherwise  provided  by  law,  all  complaints
received and any investigative file prepared or maintained by the public
advocate  regarding  matters  covered  by  this  subdivision,  shall  be
confidential.
  l. Before making public any portion of any draft, preliminary or final
report  relating  to  the  operations or activities of a city officer or
agency, the public advocate shall send a copy of the draft report to any
such officer, and to the head of any agency, discussed  in  such  report
and  provide  the  officer  and  agency,  in  writing, with a reasonable
deadline for their  review  and  response.  The  public  advocate  shall
include  in  any report, or portion thereof, which is made public a copy
of all such officer and agency responses.
  m. The public advocate may hold  public  hearings  in  the  course  of
fulfilling  the  requirements  of  this section provided that a complete
transcript of any such hearings  shall  be  made  available  for  public
inspection  free  of  charge  within  sixty  days after the hearing. The
public advocate shall also provide a copy of any requested pages of such
transcript at a reasonable  fee  to  cover  copying  and,  if  relevant,
mailing costs.
  n.  Not  later  than the thirty-first day of October of each year, the
public advocate shall present to the council a report on the  activities
of  the  office  during  the  preceding  fiscal  year.  The report shall

include: (1) a statistical summary of  the  complaints  received  during
such  fiscal  year,  categorized  by  agency,  type of complaint, agency
response, mode of resolution, and  such  other  factors  as  the  public
advocate  deems appropriate; (2) an analysis of recurring complaints and
the public advocate&#39;s recommendations for administrative, legislative or
budgetary  actions  to  resolve  the  underlying  problems  causing  the
complaints;  (3)  a  summary  of the findings and recommendations of the
agency program reviews conducted during the fiscal year and a summary of
the agency responses to such findings and recommendations; (4) a summary
of the charter requirements which, in the opinion of the public advocate
are not being implemented by the city agencies and officers  subject  to
them, including a description of the nature and extent of the failure to
comply and a summary of the responses of the agencies or officers to the
public  advocate&#39;s  conclusions;  and  (5)  a summary of improvements in
charter compliance since the public advocate&#39;s last annual  report.  The
public  advocate  shall include an assessment of the fiscal implications
of any recommendations presented in this report.

<p>Section 25.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  §  25.  Election;  term;  vacancies.  a.  The council members shall be
elected  at  the  general  election  in  the   year   nineteen   hundred
seventy-seven and every fourth year thereafter and the term of office of
each council member shall commence on the first day of January after the
elections  and  shall  continue  for  four  years  thereafter; provided,
however, that the council member elected at the general election in  the
year two thousand and one and at the general election in every twentieth
year  thereafter  shall  serve for a term of two years commencing on the
first day of January after such election; and provided further  that  an
additional  election  of  Council  Members  shall be held at the general
election in the year two thousand three  and  at  the  general  election
every  twentieth  year  thereafter  and that the members elected at each
such additional election shall serve for a term of two  years  beginning
on the first day of January after such election.
  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision of this charter or other law, a
full term of two years, as established by  this  subsection,  shall  not
constitute  a  full term under section 1138 of this charter, except that
two consecutive full terms of two years shall constitute one  full  term
under  section  1138.  A member of the council who resigns or is removed
from office prior to the completion of a full term shall  be  deemed  to
have  held  that  office for a full term for purposes of section 1138 of
the charter.
  b. Any vacancy which may occur among  the  council  members  shall  be
filled by popular election in the following manner.
  1.  Within  three  days of the occurrence of a vacancy in the council,
the mayor shall proclaim the date for the election or elections required
by this subdivision, provide notice of such  proclamation  to  the  city
clerk  and the board of elections and publish notice thereof in the City
Record. After the proclamation of the date for an election  to  be  held
pursuant  to paragraphs four or five of this subdivision, the city clerk
shall publish notice thereof not less than twice in each week  preceding
the date of such election in newspapers distributed within the city, and
the  board  of  elections  shall  mail  notice  of  such election to all
registered voters within the district in which the  election  is  to  be
held.
  2.  If  a  vacancy  occurs during the first three years of a four-year
term or the first year of a two-year term, a general  election  to  fill
the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term shall be held in the
year  in  which  the vacancy occurs, unless the vacancy occurs after the
last day on which an occurring vacancy may  be  filled  at  the  general
election in that same year with party nominations of candidates for such
election  being made at a primary election, as provided in section 6-116
of the election law. If such a vacancy occurs in  any  year  after  such
last  day, it shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired term at
the general election in the following year provided,  however,  that  no
general election to fill a vacancy shall be held in the last year of the
term,  except  as  provided in paragraph nine of this subdivision. Party
nominations of candidates for a general election to fill a  vacancy  for
the remainder of the unexpired term shall be made at a primary election,
except as provided in paragraph five of this subdivision.
  3.  If a special or general election to fill the vacancy on an interim
basis has not been previously held pursuant  to  paragraphs  four,  six,
seven  and  eight  of  this  subdivision, the person elected to fill the
vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term at  a  general  election
shall  take  office immediately upon qualification and shall serve until

on an interim basis has been previously held, the person elected to fill
the  vacancy  for  the  remainder  of  the  unexpired  term at a general

election shall take office on January first of the year  following  such
general election and shall serve until the term expires.
  4.  If  a  vacancy  occurs during the first three years of a four-year
term or in the first year of a two-year term and on or before  the  last
day in the third year of such a four-year term or the first year of such
a  two-year  term  on  which  an occurring vacancy may be filled for the
remainder of the  unexpired  term  at  a  general  election  with  party
nominations  of  candidates  for  such  election being made at a primary
election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law, a special or
general election to fill the vacancy on an interim basis shall be  held,
unless  the vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the next primary
election at which party nominations for a general election to  fill  the
vacancy  may be made and on or before the last day on which an occurring
vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the  unexpired  term  at  the
general election in the same year in which the vacancy occurs with party
nominations  of  candidates  for  such  election being made at a primary
election, as provided in section 6-116 of the election law.
  5. If a vacancy occurs after the last day  in  the  third  year  of  a
four-year  term  or  the  first  year  of  a  two-year  term on which an
occurring vacancy may be filled for the remainder of the unexpired  term
at  a general election in each year with party nominations of candidates
for such election being made at  a  primary  election,  as  provided  in
section  6-116 of the election law, but not less than ninety days before
the date of the primary election in the fourth year of such a  four-year
term  or  the  second year of such a two-year term, a special or general

shall be held.
  6.  Elections  held  pursuant  to  paragraph  four  or  five  of  this
subdivision shall be  scheduled  in  the  following  manner:  A  special
election to fill the vacancy shall be held on the first Tuesday at least
forty-five  days  after the occurrence of the vacancy, provided that the
mayor,  in  the  proclamation  required  by  paragraph   one   of   this
subdivision, may schedule such election for another day no more than ten
days  after  such  Tuesday  and  not  less  than  forty  days after such
proclamation if the mayor determines that such rescheduling is necessary
to facilitate maximum voter participation; except that
  (a) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any  year  and
the  first  Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence of the
vacancy is less than ninety days before a  regularly  scheduled  general
election  or between a primary and a general election, the vacancy shall
be filled at such general election;
  (b) if the vacancy occurs before September twentieth in any  year  and
the  first  Tuesday at least forty-five days after the occurrence of the
vacancy is after a regularly scheduled  general  election,  the  vacancy
shall be filled at such general election; and
  (c)  if the vacancy occurs on or after September twentieth in any year
and the first Tuesday at least forty-five days after the  occurrence  of
the  vacancy  is  after,  but  less  than thirty days after, a regularly
scheduled general election, the vacancy shall be  filled  at  a  special
election to be held on the first Tuesday in December in such year.
  7.  All  nominations  for elections to fill vacancies held pursuant to
paragraphs four and five of this subdivision  shall  be  by  independent
nominating  petition.  A signature on an independent nominating petition
made earlier than the date of the proclamation required by paragraph one
of this subdivision shall not be counted.
  8. A person elected to fill a vacancy in the council  at  an  election
held  pursuant  to  paragraph four of this subdivision shall take office
immediately upon qualification and serve until December thirty-first  of

the  year  in  which  the  vacancy  is  filled  for the remainder of the
unexpired term pursuant to paragraph two of this subdivision.  A  person
elected to fill a vacancy in the council at an election held pursuant to
paragraph  five  of  this subdivision shall take office immediately upon
qualification and serve until the term expires.
  9. If a vacancy occurs less than ninety days before the  date  of  the
primary election in the last year of the term, the person elected at the
general  election  in  such year for the next succeeding term shall take
office immediately upon qualification  and  fill  the  vacancy  for  the
remainder of the unexpired term.
