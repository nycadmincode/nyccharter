expense budget, and executive expense budget.   a.   The expense  budget
departmental   estimates,   the  preliminary  expense  budget,  and  the
executive expense budget for each year shall consist of  proposed  units
of   appropriation   for   personal   service   and  proposed  units  of
appropriation for other than personal service  for  the  ensuing  fiscal
year.
  b.  Each  agency  head, for the departmental estimates, and the mayor,
for the executive budget, shall submit (i) a statement of the impact  of
the  proposed  units  of  appropriation  on  the level of services to be
provided during the ensuing fiscal year and (ii)  a written response  to
each  of  the  expense  budget  priorities  included in   each community
board&#39;s statement of budget  priorities  submitted  in  accordance  with
section  two  hundred thirty of this charter,  including the disposition
of each such priority and a meaningful explanation of  any  disapprovals
contained in such estimates or budget.
  c.  Each  proposed  unit  of  appropriation shall represent the amount
requested for personal service or for other than personal service for  a
particular program, purpose, activity or institution; provided, however,
that  a  single  unit  of appropriation for personal service or a single
unit of appropriation for other than personal service may represent  the
amount requested for more than one particular program, purpose, activity
or  institution if the council has adopted, on the recommendation of the
mayor, or if the council has adopted on its own initiative and the mayor
has approved, a resolution setting forth the names, and a  statement  of
the  programmatic  objectives,  of  each  program,  purpose, activity or
institution to be included in  such  a  single  unit  of  appropriation.
Copies  of  such  resolutions  must  be  included  as an appendix to any
preliminary budget, executive budget, and adopted budget to  which  they
apply.    If,  in  accordance with such a resolution, a proposed unit of
appropriation for other than personal service shall represent the  total
amount  requested  for  other  than  personal  service for more than one
proposed unit of appropriation for personal service, the amount of  such
unit of appropriation for other than personal service which is allocable
to  each  unit  of appropriation for personal service shall be set forth
for informational purposes at the end of each such unit of appropriation
for personal service.   If, in accordance  with  such  a  resolution,  a
proposed  unit of appropriation for personal service shall represent the
total amount requested for personal service for more than  one  proposed
unit  of  appropriation  for  other than personal service, the amount of
such unit of appropriation for personal service which  is  allocable  to
each  unit of appropriation for other than personal service shall be set
forth for informational purposes  at  the  end  of  each  such  unit  of
appropriation for other than personal service.
  d.   Each proposed unit of appropriation contained in the departmental
estimates, the preliminary expense  budget  and  the  executive  expense
budget   shall  be  accompanied  by  a  statement  of  the  programmatic
objectives of the program, purpose, activity or institution involved.
  e.  Each proposed unit of appropriation contained in the  departmental
estimates  and  the  executive budget shall be   supported by line items
showing how the total amount of such unit is determined.
  f.  The departmental estimates shall be in such form and contain  such
further  information as may be required by the mayor or by law and shall
be public records which shall at all reasonable times be open to  public
inspection.
  g.    For each city agency that has local or borough service districts
within community districts and boroughs, the departmental estimates  and
the  executive  budget,  where practicable, shall contain a statement of

proposed direct expenditures in each  such  service  district  for  each
requested unit of appropriation.
  h.   The departmental estimates and the executive expense budget shall
include a contract budget prepared in accordance with the provisions  of
section one hundred four.

<p>Section 102.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  §  102.  Expense  budget borough allocations. a. Definition.  The term
&quot;discretionary increases&quot; as used in this section shall mean  an  amount
equal to the total amount of general fund expenditures of city funds and
state  and  federal funds over which the city has substantial discretion
proposed to be made in the ensuing fiscal year for  all  purposes  other
than  debt  service minus the sum of the following items as certified by
the mayor, including related fringe benefits:
  (1)  all such proposed expenditures which are necessary to continue to
operate current programs and provide current services at the  levels  at
which  they  were authorized to be operated or provided, pursuant to the
expense budget for the  current  year  as  adopted  in  accordance  with
section  two  hundred fifty-four and two hundred fifty-five or at levels
not exceeding such levels;
  (2) all proposed increases in such expenditures for  current  programs
or services which are projected to be necessary to accommodate projected
increases  in  the  caseload    of  current programs or to accommodate a
portion of such projected increases;
  (3) all proposed increases in such expenditures for  current  programs
or  services which are projected to be necessary as a result of federal,
state or local laws or judicial decisions  which  require  increases  in
benefit levels, service levels, or similar matters;
  (4)  all  proposed  increases in such expenditures for new programs or
new services required by federal, state or local  law  to  be  initiated
during the ensuing fiscal year; and
  (5)    all  proposed  expenditures,  in  excess  of  the  expenditures
specified in paragraph one of this subdivision, which are  necessary  to
continue to operate current programs and provide current services at the
levels at which they are currently authorized to be operated or provided
pursuant  to  the  expense  budget  for  the current year as modified in
accordance with section one hundred seven, excluding the portion of such
excess  which  is  attributable  to  budget  modifications  adopted   in
accordance with such section which were not necessary to (i) continue to
operate  programs  and  provide services at the level at which they were
authorized in the expense budget  for  the  current  year  as  initially
adopted, (ii) accommodate actual but unanticipated caseload increases in
such  programs,  or (iii) accommodate actual but unanticipated increases
in spending of the types referred to in paragraphs  three  and  four  of
this subdivision, and excluding that portion of any expenditure increase
which  was  financed  by  a  decrease  in  any appropriations originally
included in the executive expense budget for the current year to pay for
a discretionary increase.
  b. Borough allocation.   Five percent  of  the  total  amount  of  the
discretionary  increases  which  the  mayor  includes  in  the executive
expense budget for the ensuing fiscal year shall be allocated among  the
boroughs  by  a formula based on  factors related to population and need
and shall be known as the  expense  budget  borough  allocation.    Such
formula  shall  be  established by local law, but in any fiscal year for
which no such local  law  is  effective,  such  expense  budget  borough
allocation  shall  be  allocated  among the boroughs on the basis of the
average of (i) each borough&#39;s share of the total population of the city,
(ii) each borough&#39;s share of the total population of the city below  one
hundred  twenty-five  percent  of  the  poverty  level,  and  (iii) each
borough&#39;s share of the total land area of the  city.    Such  a  borough
allocation  shall  be reduced by any amounts necessary, in excess of the
amounts available pursuant to section one hundred two-a, to pay for  the
operating  costs,  as  certified  in  accordance  with the provisions of
subparagraph a of paragraph one of subdivision c of section two  hundred
eleven,  of    capital  project  constructed  with funds recommended for

appropriation by the borough president in accordance with the provisions
of  section two hundred eleven.
  c.   Preliminary  borough  allocations;    initial  borough  president
notification.   Concomitantly with the  submission  of  the  preliminary
expense  budget,  the  mayor  shall inform each borough president of the
portion of the executive expense budget for the ensuing fiscal year  and
for  the  three  subsequent  fiscal  years that, pursuant to the formula
required by subdivision b of this section, would be  allocated  to  each
borough  if  the  amount  of the discretionary increases for the ensuing
fiscal year  and for the three subsequent years were  the  same  as  the
amounts  projected  by the mayor, in accordance with section one hundred
one, to be available for such purposes in such years.    The  amount  of
such  portion  shall  be known as the preliminary expense budget borough
allocation.
  d. Borough president proposals.   Each borough president,  during  the
consultations  required  by section two hundred forty-four, shall submit
to the mayor, in such  form  as  the  mayor  shall  prescribe,  proposed
appropriations  for  the  expense  budget  not  exceeding such borough&#39;s
allocation of the expense budget borough allocation as certified by  the
mayor  to  the borough presidents during such consultations.  The timing
of such certification shall allow sufficient time for such consultations
and for  meeting  the  deadlines  established  by  section  two  hundred
forty-nine.    The  mayor  shall  include  such  proposed appropriations
without modification in the executive expense budget in accordance  with
the  provisions  of  subdivision  two  of  section  one  hundred  three;
provided, however, that the mayor may also  include  such  comments  and
recommendations  relating  to  such proposed appropriations as the mayor
may deem proper.

<p>Section 104.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  §  104.  Contract  budget.  a. Each contract budget shall set forth by
agency each major category of contractual  services  and  each  multiple
purpose  category  of  contractual services for which appropriations are
being proposed.
  b. Each agency head for the departmental estimates, the mayor for  the
executive budget, and the council for the adopted budget by a resolution
adopted  with  the  budget,  shall  certify  that each major category of
contractual services is presented as such and that no  multiple  purpose
category contains a major category of contractual services.
  c. For purposes of this section
  1. the term &quot;major category&quot; shall mean:
  (a) a programmatic category related to a major service provided by the
agency  or  a  major  responsibility  of the agency regardless of dollar
amount; or
  (b) a programmatic category related to a particular state  or  federal
requirement; or
  (c) a subcategory of those categories set forth in subparagraph a or b
of this paragraph where the dollar amount constitutes a major commitment
of city funds; or
  (d) a category established by the council as a major category pursuant
to subdivision f of this section; or
  (e) a category certified by the mayor as a major category.
  2. the term &quot;multiple purpose category&quot; shall mean:
  (a)  groupings  of  contractual services for related purposes, none of
which individually constitute  a  major  category,  but  which  together
facilitate  public  understanding of contractual spending provided by an
agency; or
  (b) a grouping of unrelated contractual services,  which  individually
do  not  constitute  a  major  category, and which are not appropriately
grouped with other contractual spending of the agency.
  3. the term &quot;contractual services&quot; shall mean technical, consultant or
personal services provided to the city through contracts.
  d. Major categories. Each major category of contractual services shall
be accompanied by a detailed description of the programmatic  objectives
of the category, the number of contracts estimated to be included in the
category and the proposed appropriations for that category.
  e.  Multiple  purpose categories. All other contractual services shall
be aggregated in multiple  purpose  categories.  Each  multiple  purpose
category shall be accompanied by the number of contracts estimated to be
included  in  the  category and the supporting schedules identifying the
purposes and amounts involved in sufficient detail to allow the  council
to  certify  that  the  category  does  not  contain major categories of
contractual services.
  f. Change of categories. The council may alter  any  category  in  the
contract  budget  submitted  by  the  mayor,  or  change  any  terms and
conditions of it. The mayor shall  provide  sufficient  information  and
technical  assistance to allow the council to certify each category as a
major or  multiple  purpose  category.  The  mayor  may  disapprove  any
alteration  by the council. The mayor&#39;s disapproval may be overridden by
a two-thirds vote of all of the members of the council.
  g. Adoption of contract budget. The council  may  increase,  decrease,
add or omit any amount in the contract budget as submitted by the mayor,
or  change  any terms and conditions of the amount in that category. The
mayor may disapprove any increase or addition  to  the  amounts  in  the
categories,  or  any  change  in  any term and condition of the contract
budget. The mayor&#39;s disapproval may be overridden by a  two-thirds  vote
of all of the members of the council.

  h.  Modification of terms and conditions. All spending for contractual
services shall be in accordance with the terms  and  conditions  of  the
contract  budget  as  adopted; provided, however, that during any fiscal
year the mayor shall notify the council of any proposed modification  of
such a term or condition. Within thirty days of the first stated meeting
of  the  council  following  the receipt of such notice, the council may
disapprove the proposed notification.

<p>Section 106.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  §  106.  Expense  budget  administration.    a.    Except as otherwise
provided by law,  no  unit  of  appropriation  shall  be  available  for
expenditure  by  any  city agency until schedules   fixing positions and
salaries  and  setting  forth  other  expenses  within  the   units   of
appropriation  are  established  pursuant  to  the  adopted  budget, the
administration of which is subject to the provisions  of  this  chapter,
the civil service law, and other applicable law.
  b.  The  mayor  shall  establish  and  may  modify for each agency (1)
quarterly spending allotments for each unit  of  appropriation  and  (2)
aggregate  position  and  salary  limits for each unit of appropriation,
which shall be made available for public review  upon  adequate  notice.
No  agency  shall  expend  any  sum in excess of such quarterly spending
allotments, or exceed aggregate position and salary limits.   The  mayor
may  set  aside  specified sums as necessary reserves which shall not be
included in the quarterly spending  allotments  until  released  by  the
mayor.    Each  agency  shall  administer  all  monies  appropriated  or
available for programs and purposes of the  agency  in  accordance  with
quarterly  allotment  plans  proposed  by  the  agency  and  approved or
modified by the mayor.   Each such plan shall  set  forth  by  units  of
appropriation  for  the quarter of the fiscal year during which it is to
remain in effect:  (1) rates of expenditures for personal  services  and
other  than  personal  services;  (2)  ceilings  on  the total number of
uniformed, civilian and pedagogical employees; and (3) the total  amount
of funds to be spent or committed by the agency during such quarter.
  c.    The  mayor shall keep informed, during the course of each fiscal
year, of the progress of expenditures and the receipt of  revenues,  and
it  shall  be  the duty of all agencies, when requested by the mayor, to
supply all information needed for this purpose.
  d.  The mayor may assume direct responsibility for the  administration
of  the  schedule  required  to  be filed by the agency head pursuant to
subsection a of this section when in the  mayor&#39;s  judgment  the  fiscal
condition  of  the  city  so requires or when an agency (1) is expending
funds in excess of the quarterly spending allotments or (2) is otherwise
not complying with spending allotments or aggregate position and  salary
limits   or  (3)  is  not  maintaining  adequate  accounts  pursuant  to
requirements of this charter.
  e. Whenever the mayor determines, pursuant to the provisions  of  this
charter  or  other  relevant  statutes,  that  the  full  amount  of any
appropriation should not be available for expenditure during the  fiscal
year,  the  mayor shall notify the council of such determination and the
implications and consequences of those impoundments for  service  levels
and programmatic goals affected. The mayor shall respond in writing to a
request by the council for an explanation of why an appropriation should
not be expended.
  f.  1.  Within  thirty  days  of the adoption of the executive expense
budget, the head of each agency responsible  for  one  or  more  of  the
services  listed  in  paragraph four of this subdivision shall submit to
each borough president, a plan for the allocation within the borough  of
the  personnel  and  resources appropriated for each such service in the
borough.
  2. Within thirty days of receiving such a plan, the borough  president
may  propose  a  reallocation  of the personnel and resources within the
borough. Such proposed reallocations shall be implemented by the agency,
unless the head of the  agency  objects,  in  writing,  to  the  borough
president.  If such an objection is submitted, the borough president may
submit a revised reallocation proposal to the agency head which shall be
implemented by the agency head provided that no  such  modification  may

increase  or  decrease  the  personnel  or  resources  allocated  to any
community district for such service by more than five percent.
  3.  If,  during  the  course  of  the fiscal year, however, a material
reallocation of personnel or resources within a borough  is  anticipated
by  an  agency  head  to  be necessary for any of the services listed in
subdivision four,  the  agency  head  shall  consult  with  the  borough
president prior to the implementation of any such reallocation.
  4.  The  services  covered  by  this  subdivision  shall  include  the
following services and  any  additional  services  identified  for  this
purpose  by  the mayor: local parks services, street cleaning and refuse
collection, housing code enforcement, highway and street maintenance and
repair, sewer maintenance and repair,  and  the  maintenance  of  public
buildings by the department of citywide administrative services.

pursuant  to section one hundred six, and to other applicable provisions
of this charter, of the civil service law and of other law,  changes  in
schedules,  within  units  of  appropriation, may be made by the head of

  b.  The mayor during any fiscal year may transfer part or all  of  any
unit of appropriation to another unit of appropriation, except that when
any  such  transfer (1) shall be from one agency to another or (2) shall
result in any unit of appropriation having been increased  or  decreased
by  more  than  five  per  cent  or fifty thousand dollars, whichever is
greater, from the budget as adopted for such unit of appropriation,  the
mayor  shall  notify  the council of the proposed action.  Within thirty

one hundred two only  with  the  concurrence  of  the  relevant  borough
president;  and  a borough president may make such a recommendation with
regard to such an appropriation if it is concurred in by the  mayor  and
does not include a reduction in an appropriation other than one included
in  the budget pursuant to section one hundred two on the recommendation
of such borough president.  Written notice of any transfer  pursuant  to
this  subdivision  shall  be  given  to  the  comptroller  and  shall be
published in the City Record as soon as possible after such transfer.
  c.  The provisions of this section shall not be  deemed  to  authorize
any transfer from appropriations required by law.
  d.  The council may during any fiscal year transfer part or all of any
unit  of  appropriation  within  the  council appropriation to any other
council unit of appropriation for any of its programs or projects or for
any other purpose, solely by adoption of a  council  resolution.    Each
such  transfer  shall be published in the City Record and written notice
thereof shall be given to the mayor and to the comptroller not less than
ten days before the effective date thereof.
  e.  The procedures and required approvals  pursuant  to  sections  two
hundred  fifty-four,  two hundred fifty-five, and two hundred fifty-six,
without regard to the dates specified therein, shall be followed in  the
case  of:  (1)  any  proposed  amendment  to  the  budget respecting the
creation of new units of appropriation; or (2) the appropriation of  new
revenues  from  any  source  except  for revenues from federal, state or
private sources  in  regard  to  the  use  of  which  the  city  has  no
discretion;  provided,  however, that the mayor shall give notice to the
council of the receipt and proposed utilization of any such revenues; or
(3) the proposed use by the  city  of  previously  unappropriated  funds
received  from  any  source.    Any  request  by the mayor respecting an
amendment to the budget that involves an increase in the budget shall be

identifiable  and  currently available funds required for the payment of
such additional amounts.
