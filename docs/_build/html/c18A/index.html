<p>Section 440.</p>
<div class="highlight-default"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>  § 440. Public complaints against members of the police department. (a)
It  is in the interest of the people of the city of New York and the New
York  city  police  department  that  the  investigation  of  complaints
concerning  misconduct  by officers of the department towards members of
the public be complete, thorough and impartial. These inquires  must  be
conducted  fairly and independently, and in a manner in which the public
and the police  department  have  confidence.  An  independent  civilian
complaint  review board is hereby established as a body comprised solely
of members of the public with the authority to  investigate  allegations
of police misconduct as provided in this section.
  (b) Civilian complaint review board.
  1.  The  civilian  complaint  review  board  shall consist of thirteen
members of the public appointed by the mayor, who shall be residents  of
the  city  of  New  York  and  shall reflect the diversity of the city&#39;s
population.  The members of the board shall be appointed as follows: (i)
five members, one from each of the five boroughs, shall be designated by
the city council; (ii) three members with experience as law  enforcement
professionals  shall be designated by the police commissioner; and (iii)
the remaining five members shall be selected by  the  mayor.  The  mayor
shall select one of the members to be chair.
  2.  No  member  of  the  board  shall  hold any other public office or
employment.  No  members,  except  those  designated   by   the   police
commissioner, shall have experience as law enforcement professionals, or
be  former  employees  of  the  New York city police department. For the
purposes of this section, experience as a law  enforcement  professional
shall  include  experience  as  a police officer, criminal investigator,
special agent, or a managerial or  supervisory  employee  who  exercised
substantial  policy discretion on law enforcement matters, in a federal,
state, or local law enforcement agency,  other  than  experience  as  an
attorney in a prosecutorial agency.
  3.  The  members  shall  be appointed for terms of three years, except
that of the members first appointed, four shall be appointed  for  terms
of  one  year, of whom one shall have been designated by the council and
two shall have been designated by the police commissioner, four shall be
appointed for terms of two years, of whom two shall have been designated
by the council, and five shall be appointed for terms of three years, of
whom two shall have been designated by the council and  one  shall  have
been designated by the police commissioner.
  4. In the event of a vacancy on the board during the term of office of
a  member  by  reason  of  removal,  death, resignation, or otherwise, a
successor  shall  be  chosen  in  the  same  manner  as   the   original
appointment.  A  member  appointed to fill a vacancy shall serve for the
balance of the unexpired term.
  (c) Powers and duties of the board.
  1. The board shall have the power to receive, investigate, hear,  make
findings  and  recommend action upon complaints by members of the public
against  members  of  the  police  department  that  allege   misconduct
involving  excessive  use  of force, abuse of authority, discourtesy, or
use of offensive language, including, but not limited to, slurs relating
to race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation and disability.
The findings and recommendations of the board, and the  basis  therefor,
shall   be   submitted   to  the  police  commissioner.  No  finding  or
recommendation shall be  based  solely  upon  an  unsworn  complaint  or
statement,  nor  shall  prior  unsubstantiated,  unfounded  or withdrawn
complaints be the basis for any such finding or recommendation.
  2. The board shall promulgate rules of procedure  in  accordance  with
the  city  administrative  procedure act, including rules that prescribe
the  manner  in  which  investigations   are   to   be   conducted   and

recommendations  made  and the manner by which a member of the public is
to be informed of the status of his or her  complaint.  Such  rules  may
provide for the establishment of panels, which shall consist of not less
than  three  members of the board, which shall be empowered to supervise
the  investigation  of  complaints,  and  to  hear,  make  findings  and
recommend  action  on  such  complaints.  No  such  panel  shall consist
exclusively of members designated by the council, or designated  by  the
police commissioner, or selected by the mayor.
  3.  The  board,  by  majority  vote  of  its  members,  may compel the
attendance of witnesses and require the production of such  records  and
other  materials  as  are  necessary for the investigation of complaints
submitted pursuant to this section.
  4. The board shall establish a mediation program pursuant to  which  a
complainant  may  voluntarily  choose to resolve a complaint by means of
informal conciliation.
  5. The board is authorized, within appropriations available  therefor,
to  appoint  such  employees as are necessary to exercise its powers and
fulfill its duties. The board shall  employ  civilian  investigators  to
investigate all complaints.
  6.  The  board  shall  issue  to  the  mayor  and  the  city council a
semi-annual report which shall describe its activities and summarize its
actions.
  7. The board shall have the responsibility  of  informing  the  public
about  the  board  and  its  duties, and shall develop and administer an
on-going  program  for  the  education  of  the  public  regarding   the
provisions of this chapter.
  (d) Cooperation of police department.
  1.  It  shall  be  the  duty  of the police department to provide such
assistance as the board may reasonably request, to cooperate fully  with
investigations  by  the  board, and to provide to the board upon request
records and other materials which are necessary for the investigation of
complaints submitted pursuant to this section, except  such  records  or
materials that cannot be disclosed by law.
  2. The police commissioner shall ensure that officers and employees of
the  police  department  appear  before  and respond to inquiries of the
board  and  its  civilian   investigators   in   connection   with   the
investigation of complaints submitted pursuant to this section, provided
that   such  inquiries  are  conducted  in  accordance  with  department
procedures for interrogation of members.
  3. The police commissioner shall report to the  board  on  any  action
taken  in cases in which the board submitted a finding or recommendation
to the police commissioner with respect to a complaint.
  (e) The provisions of this section shall not be construed to limit  or
impair the authority of the police commissioner to discipline members of
the department. Nor shall the provisions of this section be construed to
limit   the  rights  of  members  of  the  department  with  respect  to
disciplinary action, including but not limited to the  right  to  notice
and  a  hearing,  which  may  be  established by any provision of law or
otherwise.
  (f) The provisions of this section shall not be construed  to  prevent
or  hinder the investigation or prosecution of members of the department
for violations of law by any court of competent  jurisdiction,  a  grand
jury, district attorney, or other authorized officer, agency or body.
